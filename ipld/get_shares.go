// NumWorkersLimit sets global limit for workers spawned by GetShares.
// GetShares could be called MaxSquareSize(128) times per data square each
// spawning up to 128/2 goroutines and altogether this is 8192. Considering
// there can be N blocks fetched at the same time, e.g. during catching up data
// from the past, we multiply this number by the amount of allowed concurrent
// data square fetches(NumConcurrentSquares).
//
// NOTE: This value only limits amount of simultaneously running workers that
// are spawned as the load increases and are killed, once the load declines.
// TODO(@Wondertan): This assumes we have parallelized DASer implemented.
//  Sync the values once it is shipped.
// TODO(@Wondertan): Allow configuration of values without global state.

// GetShares gets shares from either local storage, or, if not found, requests
// them from immediate/connected peers. It puts them into the given 'put' func,
// does not return any error, and returns/unblocks only on success
// (got all shares) or on context cancellation.
//
// It works concurrently by spawning workers in the pool which do one basic
// thing - block until data is fetched, s. t. share processing is never
// sequential, and thus we request *all* the shares available without waiting
// for others to finish. It is the required property to maximize data
// availability. As a side effect, we get concurrent tree traversal reducing
// time to data time.
//
// GetShares relies on the fact that the underlying data structure is a binary
// tree, so it's not suitable for anything else besides that. Parts on the
// implementation that rely on this property are explicitly tagged with
// (bin-tree-feat).
